title: Minority Blocks in Ohio
---

At my job at the Voinovich School, I spend my time doing data analysis for public policy analysis and research. One project that we have been working on recently is creating a shiny app using R to show where minorities are located in the block level. (The app is for a statewide project and you can find more information about it at the link below) I think the app is really neat because you can find a really strong divide between minority and non-minority populated areas. When looking at it, I find Areas like Cuyahoga county and Mahoning counties to be very interesting. Check it out (especially at the block level) and tell me what you think: [Ohio Minorities Map](https://abidan.shinyapps.io/OhioMinorities)

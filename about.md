I am a huge data enthusiast. I love data of many forms and love doing everything with them from visualizations to statistical analyses. To me, data is like the magic that flows within a wizard that gives them their power, but what is a without his/her wand? My wand happens to be R. My experience in R has helped me unlock the secrets hidden in data for my research assistant job at the Voinovich School and I have learned so much from doing so. Of course I am only at the intermediate stage of data science, but I am working my way up and learning more each day. With each new project at work I find new unique and quick ways to go about new challenges. Of course I learn a lot from school as well and I hope to become a great data scientist one day and use my powers to create more good on this earth.

### More Information

I would like to add that I will try to stay unbiased and accurate as I can, but I assume that this will not always be the case. If you would like to inform me of something I said to be wrong or you would like to just argue with me, then you can contact me using the information below. I will probably be happy to hear from anyone and I do understand the importance of spreading knowledge, so don't be afraid to do so. For more information about me, you can check out <a href="resume" target="_blank">my resume here</a> or just email me directly.

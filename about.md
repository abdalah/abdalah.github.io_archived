I am an undergraduate student at Ohio University. I am a junior working towards a bachelors of science in applied mathematics and economics with a minor in computer science. I am the secretary of the OU Economics Society and a member of the OU Association for Computing Machinery, the OU Math Club, and even Blue Pencil Comedy (the local stand-up club). My hope is to go into data science and modeling for economics, mathematics, and statistics. I work as a data analyst in the Voinovich School of Public Affairs and Leadership.
